# Cross-compile Golang

Curious wether ARM works out of the box.

Using ``centurylink/golang-builder-cross`` with ``BUILD_GOARCH="386 amd64 arm"``.
But needs make.bash for darwin/arm [294342012].

[294342012](https://travis-ci.org/bvberkum/x-ci/builds/294342012)

Not sure about the value for ``BUILD_GOOS`` it uses.
[Seems there's a lot of choice](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20728767/all-possible-goos-value)

So testing just Linux OS initially at least.
